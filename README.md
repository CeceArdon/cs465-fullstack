CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
HTML is a markup language that is used to format web content. It's used to design the structure and layout of web pages, as well as to add text, images, and other multimedia material to them. JavaScript is a computer language that allows web pages to have dynamic behavior. It supports interaction with features such as user input validation, animations, and real-time updates, among others. Express HTML is a server-side rendering technique in which the server creates HTML for each web page and transmits it to the client for display. It can be used to create classic multi-page web applications where the server generates each page. Single-page applications (SPAs), on the other hand, are online apps that load a single HTML page and use JavaScript to dynamically refresh the content. Because the page does not need to reload each time the user interacts with the application, SPAs provide a more fluid and interactive user experience. They are usually created with a frontend JavaScript framework like React, Vue, or Angular. When developing a full-stack online application, it is customary to start with Express HTML and build a traditional server-rendered application, then transition to an SPA approach as the program expands in complexity and interactivity. This enables better separation of concerns between frontend and backend development, as well as more efficient development and testing of each component. To summarize, HTML, JavaScript, Express, and single-page applications are all key components in building modern web applications, and their utilization is determined by the application's specific requirements.

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is document-oriented, which means it can store data in a flexible and dynamic fashion. In comparison to typical SQL databases, which have a rigid schema, this enables for simpler growth and customization of the data model. MongoDB is built to manage high-volume, high-speed data. It may be horizontally scaled by adding nodes to a cluster, making it easy to scale as the application grows. Overall, the decision to employ a NoSQL MongoDB database as the backend of a full-stack application can be influenced by aspects like as the data model's flexibility and scalability, performance requirements, and the necessity for sophisticated query capabilities.

Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON is frequently used in web development to communicate data between a web application's frontend and backend. When a user interacts with a web page, the frontend code (which is typically written in JavaScript) sends a request for data to the backend server. The request is processed by the server, and the desired data is returned in JSON format. After that, the frontend code parses the JSON data and changes the web page. JSON connects the frontend and backend development parts by offering a standardized way for them to share data. This enables developers to build web apps on the frontend and backend using different programming languages and frameworks, as long as they adhere to the agreed-upon JSON standard for data interchange. This simplifies the development of sophisticated web applications with multiple levels of functionality, as well as the maintenance of the codebase over time.

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
Every week, we had to refactor the code to make the application seem better. For example, the last stage of the project entails using an Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) to create components and data service for the client-facing front-end Single Page Application (SPA). In this assignment, I planned and developed a SPA that will render a client-side web page using Bootstrap CSS, with admin capabilities written in Angular using reusable UI components and logic. Angular provides a plethora of completely integrated tools to aid in the development process. When the application is finished, I will test the capabilities for displaying and amending trips. Reusable UI components can help developers save time and effort by allowing them to reuse existing components rather than generating new ones from scratch. This can help to accelerate development, eliminate defects, and enhance overall code quality. Reusable UI components can be used in many situations and tailored to specific use cases. This means that developers can construct a library of components that can be reused across numerous projects, saving time and effort when creating new UI elements from start.

Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
In a full-stack application, the frontend communicates with the backend using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), which allow different components of the application to connect with one another. Endpoints in APIs are URLs that can be used to request or deliver data to the backend. Requests to API endpoints can be made using various methods, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The GET method is used to obtain data from an endpoint, while the POST method is used to create new data, the PUT method is used to update existing data, and the DELETE method is used to delete data. API testing must include security measures since APIs can be subject to security risks such as injection attacks, flawed authentication and authorization, and cross-site scripting (XSS) assaults. Security techniques such as authentication, authorization, and encryption can be used to alleviate these threats. Authentication confirms the identity of the user or component making the API request, whereas authorization establishes if the user or component is authorized to access the requested resource. Encryption can be used to safeguard sensitive data exchanged between the frontend and the backend. To summarize, methods and endpoints are critical components of API architecture in a full-stack application, and testing is required to guarantee they work properly. API testing must also consider security, as APIs might be subject to a variety of security threats. Implementing suitable security measures can help to minimize these threats and protect the application's and its users' safety.

Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course has provided me with a deeper grasp of full-stack programming and everything that goes into it. I was tasked with designing the architecture of a web application, developing and integrating a database using frameworks, and building a web application using frameworks. The significance of well-designed applications, security, and other factors. This will assist me in becoming a good software developer.
